When I was very small,
my parents would tell me stories before I slept,
so I was very interested in fairy tales.
The famous stories like the little mermaid,
Cinderella and Snow White are very familiar to me.
The things I learned from these stories made me a strong girl. 
As a girl, I knew I must have strong will as these heroes.
They never gave up when they met problems.
So if I insisted, I could win at last.
The most important thing for me to learn was to keep a kind heart.
These fairy tales told people that nice people would have a happy ending,
which was the right value.
